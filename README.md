# Restaurant-Table-Slot-System

A table reservation is an arrangement made in advance to have a table available at a restaurant. At the same time, most restaurants in the vast majority of the world do not require a reservation. The purpose of this paper is to present a case study of table reservation in the restaurant business. The researchers propose a restaurant table slot system where a particular table's value is periodically evaluated and updated. The key here is to determine whether there are available seats for each table at a time so that the reservation requests of different sizes can be decided to be either accepted or denied to maximize not only the table utilization but also the seat utilization. The essence of which is to compare the future expected revenue. The system should indicate all the important details of the client and can be seen and input through the database. Using the data, the numerical test shows a significant revenue improvement potential from our proposed system.
